# Moment3dt208g

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8 and makes up my work for Moment 3 - Angular I in the course "Programmering i TypeScript" (DT208G) at Mittuniversitet.

## Description
This project is a simple website created to fulfill the requirements for this assignment. It is an Angular site with a component structure that consists of three pages. One page is dedicated to converting values. There are three images on the site, a functioning navigation bar created using Angulars router module and additional components have been created and inserted (the tools to convert values for example). The design is responsive and has been created using CSS both in the general styles.css file and in the individual components. 

## Features
* Home: Three images of cats.
* Convert: Temperature conversion (Fahrenheit ↔ Celsius).
* Convert: Length conversion (Feet ↔ Meters).
* Convert: Two-way data binding.
* About: Information about the assignment and my work (in Swedish).
* Component based structure.
* Responsive design.

## Technologies Used

* Angular (with standalone components)
* HTML
* CSS
* TypeScript

## Run Locally
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/gustafsson96/moment3dt208g.git 
2. Install necessary dependencies by running: npm install
3. To start a local development server, run: ng serve

## Default Angular Content

### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

### Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
