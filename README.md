## Description
This project is a simple website created to fulfill the requirements for this assignment. It is an Angular site with a component structure that consists of three pages. One page is dedicated to converting values. There are three images on the site, a functioning navigation bar created using Angulars router module and additional components have been created and inserted (the tools to convert values for example). The design is responsive and has been created using CSS both in the general styles.css file and in the individual components.
